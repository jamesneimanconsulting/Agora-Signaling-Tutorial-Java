This open source sample project demonstrates how to quickly integrate the Agora Signaling SDK for a simple Signal multi-instance or Signal single-instance JAVA chat application.

The following features are included in this sample project:

- Create multiple Signal instances or single Signal instances (the example project has two entries, SingleSignalObjectMain is Signal single instance entry, and MulteSignalObjectMain2 is Signal multi-instance entry)
- Create a target account and log in
- Select chat mode (1. Peer-to-peer private chat 2. Into the channel, multi-person chat group to chat)
- Type in the account name or channel name of the other party (decided by the chat mode of the previous step)
- Show private chat chat history
- Send channel message, receive channel message
- Leave the chat group
- Logout

## Integration mode & run the sample program
* Step 1: Register an account at [Agora.io] (https://dashboard.agora.io/cn/signup/) and create your own test project to get the appId
Then select the Constant.java file in your test project, add appId to the set app_ids, and if you want to implement multiple instances, you will need to add more than one appId.
`` `java
app_ids.add ("Your appId");
`` `
* Step 2: Download the Java Agora Signaling SDK at [Agora.io SDK] (https://docs.agora.io/cn/2.0.2/download), create the lib folder at the root of the sample project, after unpacking the file, copy the jar package under the Lib folder and the jar package under the libs-dep to the Lib file of this project.
* Step 3: Import the sample project to your development tools as a gradle project.

## Operating environment
